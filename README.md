## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid (for centering)
- Mobile-first approach

### What I learned
This challenge helped me better understand how to structure a simple layout using semantic HTML.  
I also practiced centering a card component on the page and working with spacing, typography, and border radius to closely match a design.

One important thing I learned was how to think about layout before writing CSS, especially deciding when to use  or Grid.

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to focus more on:
- Improving my layout confidence
- Writing cleaner and more readable CSS
- Reducing unnecessary wrappers in my HTML

### Useful resources
- CSS Grid documentation on MDN  
- Frontend Mentor community solutions for inspiration
